% SEDREAMS is a method for Glottal Closure Instant (GCI) determination.
%
% Octave compatible
%
% Description
%  The Speech Event Detection based on the Residual Excitation And
%  Mean-based Signal (SEDREAMS) is described in [1] and [2]. It acts in two
%  successive steps. First short intervals where GCIs are expected to occur
%  are derived from the mean-based signal. This ensures good reliability
%  performance. In the second step, the precise location of each GCI is
%  refined by inspecting the residual excitation signal. This leads to good
%  accuracy performance.
%
% Inputs
%  wave             : [samples] [Nx1] input signal (speech signal)
%  fs               : [Hz]      [1x1] sampling frequency
%  f0mean           : [Hz] [1x1] an estimate of the averaged F0 used by
%                     the speaker. This can be estimated using the "pitch_srh"
%                     function included in this toolbox (or using any other pitch
%                     tracker).
%  polarity         : [1x1] the polarity of the speech signal (-1 or +1).
%                     If unknown, you can use the "polarity_reskew" function
%                     available in this toolbox.
%
% Outputs
%  gci              : [s] vector containing the location of the estimated GCIs.
%                     Note that GCIs are estimated even during unvoiced segments.
%                     Proper voicing boundaries should then be used as a mask
%                     (you can use the "pitch_srh" function included in this 
%                     toolbox for this).
%  MeanBasedSignal  : [samples] [Nx1] mean-based signal as used by the
%                     SEDREAMS algorithm
%  res              : [samples] [Nx1] the residual excitation signal
%
